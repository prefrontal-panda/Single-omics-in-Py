# Single-omics-in-Py
For single-omics analysis in Python. Just to give it a go.

Proteomics data is from the similar source as in the 'Proteomics and Metabolomics Integration' repository.
  i.e. From the article; Harutyunyan et al. 2022 Int. J. Mol. Sci. (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23116063)
        Proteomics data is available on ProteomeXchange with dataset identifier PXD033987
       
       
This should be mainly basic analysis such as clustering analysis.
